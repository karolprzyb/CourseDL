# CourseDL
Browser extension to help you download course videos for offline viewing and reference

This extension as it sits can be imported into chrome by enabling developer mode in the extensions tab and loading it as an "unpacked extension". To use just visit a course page with a video and wait a few seconds, the extension should do the rest and start the downloads. The logic was modeled based on a particular page structure so you may have to make some modifications to fit your exact course page. The extension settings page can be used to adjust the video number which is automatically pre-pended to the video name. Useful when switching courses or if you accidentally download the wrong video in a sequence and need to decrement the 'curent video number'.

This is pretty bare bones and not robust to page changes, but I hope it makes downloading videos a little less drudgerous.
